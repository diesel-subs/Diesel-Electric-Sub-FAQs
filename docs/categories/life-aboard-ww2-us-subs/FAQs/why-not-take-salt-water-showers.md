# Why not take salt water showers?


=== "Short Answer"
    An occasional salt water shower wouldn’t be a problem.

=== "Detailed Answer"
    An occasional salt water shower wouldn’t be a problem.  However, regular showers with sea water irritates the skin.  Soon the sailors would be scratching themselves and raising welts with infections possible.  Since this isn’t a terribly good idea, the boat is not plumbed to have salt water in the showers.
