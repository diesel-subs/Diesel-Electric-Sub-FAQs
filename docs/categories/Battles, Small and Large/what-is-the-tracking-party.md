=== "Detailed Answer"
    This is the group of sailors who would help the captain track the progress of the target. It would include the personnel to log events, plot the target’s movements relative to the boat, and to man the Torpedo Data Computer or TDC. This is the device that calculates the final course for any torpedoes. However, at this early stage, the TDC is important because it provides a running estimate of the target’s location and movement. It helps the captain assess the status of his attack plan.
