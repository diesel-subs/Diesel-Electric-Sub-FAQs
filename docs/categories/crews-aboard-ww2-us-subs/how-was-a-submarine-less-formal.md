# How was a submarine less formal?


=== "Short Answer"
    The main factor is that there isn’t enough room for formality. Uniforms might be less uniform. On long patrols in the tropics, “uniforms” became very relaxed. In WW2 submarines, shaving generally wasn’t required. There was more banter and informal conversations. In quiet times, there would be verbal rehearsals for equipment failures or casualties.

All of this was usually acceptable as long as everyone was also paying attention to their tasks and doing them well.

    Another example is that “officers’ country” can’t be avoided as it can on a surface ship.  There is only one level that can be used to get through the boat.  The crew has work to do or meals to eat that require passing through the officers’ and chiefs’ berthing in the forward battery.

    However, being less formal did not mean that the officers or crew were disrespectful or less precise when doing their jobs.
