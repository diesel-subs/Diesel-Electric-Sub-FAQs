=== "Summary"
    That is actually a valid question. Modern submarines, even the non-nuclear boats of other navies, don’t look anything like the Pampanito from the outside.
=== "Detailed Answer"
    That is actually a valid question. Modern submarines, even the non-nuclear boats of other navies, don’t look anything like the Pampanito from the outside. They are sleek black shapes and are mostly underwater. Only a little of the hull shows along with the upright sail. Unlike the Pampanito, they have no guns. But, yes, this is what was described as a submarine in World War 2.
