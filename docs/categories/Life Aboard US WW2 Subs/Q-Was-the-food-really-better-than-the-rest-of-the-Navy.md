=== "Detailed Answer"
    Surprisingly, the food on submarines was the best food in the seagoing Navy.  That goes back to the earliest days on subs.  President Theodore Roosevelt visited one of our first submarines in 1901 or 1902.  It was apparent that there needed to be some added incentives to get sailors to serve on those primitive boats.  The answers were to increase the pay and to increase the food allowance.

    The food incentive was to increase the allowance per sailor on board.  The Navy provides a certain amount per enlisted sailor for meals each day when assigned to a ship.  The Navy provides a larger amount for those sailors assigned to submarines.  Therefore, the Supply Officer and the cooks can order the special things from the standard stores list a little more often.  Examples might be that they could order more frozen shrimp for shrimp cocktails or they could order better cuts of steaks more often.

    As a result of this incentive, the quality of the food on submarines became a fairly big deal.  There are stories of captains fighting over good cooks, perhaps even physically.  And you certainly didnâ€™t want to be a bad cook on a submarine.  You may not last long on the boats.
