=== "Short Answer"
    Since it has to be palatable to everyone aboard, it would tend to be basic. Perhaps it could be best described as basic American food – meat, vegetables and potatoes or perhaps rice or pasta.

    Much of the food was canned although there was some freezer and refrigerated space aboard.  Fresh vegetables and fruit didn’t last long.  Neither did fresh milk.  Eggs and butter would be stored in the forward escape trunk and might last a bit longer.  (The escape trunk might be the coolest place on a submarine but, if you are in the tropics, it wasn’t really very cool.)  Bread, rolls and perhaps pies or cakes were baked fresh each evening.  Much of this is also true of surface ships.  Food on submarines was not much more limited than it was on surface ships.
    
    To be fair, the crews might still grumble about the food.  It has been said that a sailor isn’t happy unless he (or she) is complaining about something.  Sometimes the crew would drive the cooks crazy.  On one patrol, the main request might be for strawberries.  The cooks would then order more strawberries for the next patrol.  Of course, the crew would now want more peaches on that next patrol and would complain about being stuck with all those stupid strawberries.
    
    There was one overnight baker on a submarine who asked his shipmates to write home for the recipe for his favorite cake.  Get the recipe from his shipmates’ wives, girlfriends or mothers.  Then, on that sailor’s birthday, he would bake that cake for dessert.  This may not seem to be a big deal, but it mattered for morale.  Scaling up the recipe may not have been as simple as it might seem since some ingredients, such as spices, can require different proportions.
