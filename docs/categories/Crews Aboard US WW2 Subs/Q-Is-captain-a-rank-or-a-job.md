=== "Detailed Answer"
    It can be both.  The commanding officer of any ship, such as a submarine, is referred to as the captain.  Captain is also a naval rank just below admiral.  Commanding officers of large ships may be captain of that ship and also hold the rank of captain.  In WW2, captains (commanding officers) of submarines almost never held the rank of captain.  They were usually commanders or lieutenant commanders.  However, they were always addressed as captain since they were the commanding officers.
