=== "Detailed Answer"

    The typical complement of boats like the Pampanito during the war was 80 men.  This includes all of the submarines we built from 1940 and forward.  During the last year or so of the war, that number gradually increased to 85.

    The fleet boats from the 1930s had slightly fewer than 80 crewmen on board.  The earlier S-boats had far fewer men on board.  However, they were generally no longer in active combat by the last year of the war.
