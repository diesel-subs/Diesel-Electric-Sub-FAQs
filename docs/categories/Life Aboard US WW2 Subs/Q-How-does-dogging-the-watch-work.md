=== "Summary"
    It means that one watch, usually the 12:00 to 16:00 is split into two shifts of two hours each. This has the effect of changing everyone’s watch forward by four hours so no one stands the same watches all the time. This would be done about once per week.
=== "Detailed Answer"
    It means that one watch, usually the 12:00 to 16:00 is split into two shifts of two hours each.  This has the effect of changing everyone’s watch forward by four hours so no one stands the same watches all the time.  This would be done about once per week.

    For example, the schedule for watch sections could be:

    Watch section 2 in this example only stands half the 12:00 to 16:00 watch on day 7.  Section 3 stands the last half of that watch, and will stand all of it on day 8.  This gives section 2 a break from always standing mid-watches (00:00 to 04:00) and section 3 from always having the 04:00 to 08:00 watches.  Everyone now stands watch four hours earlier than before we dogged the watch.
