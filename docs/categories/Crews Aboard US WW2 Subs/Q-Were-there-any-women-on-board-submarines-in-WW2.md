=== "Detailed Answer"
    There no women serving as crew on a submarine in WW2.  There simply wasn’t any privacy.  However, there were a few women as passengers when submarines rescued them or extracted coast watchers and other key personnel from islands in the war zone.  The same was likely true for other ships, not just submarines.  Hospital ships did have nurses aboard.

    Although women have served in the Navy since 1917, when Loretta Walsh became the first women to enlist, they couldn’t serve on ships or in combat in WW2.  Fully integrating women into the Navy took time with women unable to join the Naval Academy until 1976 and couldn’t serve in combat until 1994.  This was true of all our military services.
