# Is the USS Pampanito (SS-383) really a submarine?

    
=== "Short Answer"
  That is actually a valid question.

=== "Detailed Answer"
    That is actually a valid question. Modern submarines, even non‑nuclear boats of other navies, don’t look anything like Pampanito from the outside: they’re sleek black shapes with an upright sail, mostly underwater, and have no deck guns. But yes—during World War II, boats like Pampanito were what the U.S. Navy called submarines.
