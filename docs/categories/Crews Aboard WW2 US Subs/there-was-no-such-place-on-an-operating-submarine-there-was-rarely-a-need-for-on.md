    However, there was an occasional need to confine someone.  That would usually be a Japanese POW, although that didn’t happen very often.  Japanese soldiers and sailors would usually swim away from a rescue.  It was too dishonorable to be captured.  The few that were taken aboard, for intelligence purposes, would just be handcuffed to a bunk.  Sometimes, the captured POW would want to contribute to the boat by helping with the cleaning.  If the captain and crew believed that the POW was reliable enough, they would remove the handcuffs and let him help.

    The assumption would be that if a crewmember needed to be confined, it would be easy enough to cuff him to a bunk for the rest of the patrol.
