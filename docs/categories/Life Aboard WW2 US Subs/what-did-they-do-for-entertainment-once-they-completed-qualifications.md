=== "Detailed Answer"
    The most common thing would be playing cards chess, or checkers. Acey deucey was a Navy version of backgammon. Cribbage was a frequent card game along with Bridge in the wardroom. There were also books and the radio. There were also movies, although not all were recent and they would often be shown multiple times.
    Playing cards had to be specially made or adjusted to be used under red lights. The hearts, diamonds and red numbers disappear in red light. (See below for information about the red lights.)
    When out in the Western Pacific, the radio would pick up Tokyo Rose, who was actually different persons at various times. The sailors would laugh at the propaganda – it was interesting to find out you had been sunk multiple times – but the music was surprisingly current.
    In addition, there would be the normal jumping to conclusions and the good-natured harassment of each other.
