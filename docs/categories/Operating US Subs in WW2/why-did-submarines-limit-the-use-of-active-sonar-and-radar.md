    The main reason is that they give away your presence and location long before they provide information that is useful to you. For example, let us assume that the effective range of radar was no more than seven miles early in the war.
=== "Detailed Answer"
    The main reason is that they give away your presence and location long before they provide information that is useful to you. For example, let us assume that the effective range of radar was no more than seven miles early in the war. That means that the radar pulse is strong enough to travel 14 miles – to the enemy ship or plane and back. The issue is that all of the radar pulses being sent out, that don’t hit a target and return, are going to travel out 14 miles. That means that the enemy can be aware of your presence when they are still 14 miles away but you won’t be aware of them until are within seven miles.
