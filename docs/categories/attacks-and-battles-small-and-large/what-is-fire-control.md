# What is fire control?


=== "Short Answer"
    Fire control is the equipment and process of aiming the appropriate weapons at a target. In the case of WW2 submarines, this usually meant the Torpedo Data Computer (TDC) which sent the final course, to collide with the target, to the torpedo. The torpedo stored that information in a gyroscope.
