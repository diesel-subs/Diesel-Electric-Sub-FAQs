# How fast could these submarines go on the surface?


=== "Short Answer"
    Top speed on the surface was 20 or 21 knots, about 23 miles per hour. However, this is an inefficient use of fuel. In WW2, boats departing from Pearl Harbor, Hawaii would usually run at top speed to locations such as Midway Island or Johnston Island.

=== "Detailed Answer"
    Top speed on the surface was 20 or 21 knots, about 23 miles per hour.  However, this is an inefficient use of fuel.  In WW2, boats departing from Pearl Harbor, Hawaii would usually run at top speed to locations such as Midway Island or Johnston Island.  There they would top off fuel and then proceed at efficient speeds (10 to 12 knots per hour) to their assigned patrol area.
