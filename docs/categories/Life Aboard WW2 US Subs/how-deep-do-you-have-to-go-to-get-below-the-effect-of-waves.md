    Naturally, this depends on the size of the waves. However, it quickly becomes calmer than being on the surface.
=== "Detailed Answer"
    Naturally, this depends on the size of the waves. However, it quickly becomes calmer than being on the surface. Even periscope depth is somewhat calmer than the surface. A depth of 100 feet makes a significant difference. Going to 150 or 200 feet would be below most wave action. Captains would go down to 300 or 400 feet in big storms and that would usually be calm enough. This would allow the crew to eat, digest their food and get some rest.
    Modern submarines need to be at 200 feet frequently to pick up any messages addressed to them. They have reported being bounced around quite a bit at 200 feet when they were in typhoons. Remember that waves in typhoons can be as high as 50 to 90 feet.
