# How did submarines escape?

=== "Short Answer"
    Silence and patience: slow evasion against sonar, depth/speed changes during attack runs, thermoclines, decoys, weather, and night tactics.
=== "Detailed Answer"
    Submerged evasion emphasized quiet and low speed to defeat sonar. Escorts charging in to drop depth charges briefly blinded their own sonar,
    allowing course/depth changes. Multiple attackers complicated this. Captains used thermoclines (measured via bathythermograph) to bend/reflect
    sound. U.S. boats also employed simple bubble decoys (the “giant Alka‑Seltzer” effect)—a tactic proven by the Germans. On the surface,
    skippers minimized silhouette, exploited squalls/fog, and avoided bioluminescent wakes when possible.
