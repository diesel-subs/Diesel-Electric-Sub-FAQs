=== "Detailed Answer"
    Yes and no.  An ensign is an ensign and a lieutenant is a lieutenant.  However, some were regular officers and some were reserves.

    Regular officers enter the Navy through the Naval Academy or through the scholarship program of the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps.  (In spite of the name, the NROTC program graduates both regular and reserve officers.)  Regular officers have a minimum service obligation but no definite end date.  They serve at the pleasure of the president and request to resign.

    Reserve officers enter the Navy through the non-scholarship part of the NROTC program or through various other reserve programs.  They may also come through the Officer Candidate School (OCS).  Reserve officers have a contract of a determined length but can be released early.  They may also apply to become regular officers.
