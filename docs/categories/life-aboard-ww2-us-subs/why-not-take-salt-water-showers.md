# Why not take salt water showers?


=== "Short Answer"
    An occasional salt water shower wouldn’t be a problem. However, regular showers with sea water irritates the skin. Soon the sailors would be scratching themselves and raising welts with infections possible. Since this isn’t a terribly good idea, the boat is not plumbed to have salt water in the showers.
