    In big storms, captains would sometimes go deep for 12 hours or so.  This would get the boat below most of the wave motion.  Then the crew would have some time to eat a meal and get some sleep before going back up on the surface to fight the storm.

    In very heavy seas, you may have to strap yourself into your bunk in order to stay put.
