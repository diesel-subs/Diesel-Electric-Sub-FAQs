=== "Summary"
    It seems rather ironic that most of our submarines were built in shipyards on the Atlantic side of the country while nearly all served in the Pacific. NOTE: The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard is not actually in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. It is across the Piscataqua River from Portsmouth in Kittery, Maine.

    NOTE:  The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard is not actually in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.  It is across the Piscataqua River from Portsmouth in Kittery, Maine.  Nor is the submarine base at New London, Connecticut actually located in New London.  It is across the Thames River in Groton.  In this, we actually take after the British.  Their former submarine base in Portsmouth, in the UK, was actually across the harbor in Gosport.
