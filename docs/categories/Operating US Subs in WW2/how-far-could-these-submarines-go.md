=== "Summary"
    The range of the boats built during and shortly before the war was about 11,000 nautical miles at a speed of 10 knots. They carried over 90,000 gallons of diesel. That was increased later by converting main ballast tank (MBT) four on the later boats to a fuel ballast tank (FBT), boosting the total to 110,000 gallons.
