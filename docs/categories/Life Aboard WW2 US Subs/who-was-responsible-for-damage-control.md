=== "Detailed Answer"
    Most large Navy ships have dedicated sailors for what is known as damage control parties. This is in addition to their regular assignments. Their role, in the event of a mechanical casualty or drill, is to report to the assigned damage control locker. From there, they will grab the appropriate gear and proceed to combat the problem.
    These submarines did not have assigned damage control parties. The sailors who happen to be in the compartment where the problem occurs are the damage control party. That is why every submarine sailor has to learn damage control techniques. And that is why every submarine sailor needs to know the basics of every system on the boat. They have to know how to isolate the problem and combat it effectively. This is all a part of submarine qualification and earning their dolphins.
