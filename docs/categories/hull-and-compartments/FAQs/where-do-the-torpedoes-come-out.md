# Where do the torpedoes come out?

    
=== "Short Answer"
  The forward outer torpedo‑tube doors are all the way forward, just below the first row of limber holes; they’re rectangular structures that move inward when opened.

=== "Detailed Answer"
    The forward outer torpedo‑tube doors are all the way forward, just below the first row of limber holes; they’re rectangular structures that move inward when opened. Aft outer doors are similar, though there are no nearby limber holes. On Pampanito today you can see the outlines of the top‑tube doors because the boat rides higher—she’s missing wartime weights like 100 tons of battery cells, ~400 tons of fuel, a full torpedo load with live warheads, provisions, and the 80‑man crew.
