# How much of the boat was “rigged for red”?


=== "Short Answer"
    Most of the boat would be rigged for red.

=== "Detailed Answer"
    Most of the boat would be rigged for red.  Only Maneuvering and the engine rooms would still be using white lights.  The After Torpedo Room would be rigged for red for sleeping purposes.  Crew there would have to go through the machinery spaces to get to the bridge where they are exposed to white lights unless they are wearing red glasses.
