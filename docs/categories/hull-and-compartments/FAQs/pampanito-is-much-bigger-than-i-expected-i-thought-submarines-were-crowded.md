=== "Detailed Answer"
    Pampanito is long but narrow—about 312 feet long, with a pressure hull only 16 feet in diameter and roughly 280 feet long. The lower level is all machinery, and much of the main level is occupied by equipment like engine and generator tops, fresh‑water stills, torpedo tubes and reloads, and ship control equipment. That leaves limited space for the crew—especially with 80 sailors aboard—so it feels crowded inside despite looking large outside.
