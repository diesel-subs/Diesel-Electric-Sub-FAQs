=== "Short Answer"
    Submarine sailors quickly learn to get past each other in the narrow passageways. However, there wasn’t necessarily all that much movement going to battle stations, particularly during WW2. First, you often worked and slept near your battle station.

=== "Detailed Answer"
    Submarine sailors quickly learn to get past each other in the narrow passageways.  However, there wasn’t necessarily all that much movement going to battle stations, particularly during WW2.  First, you often worked and slept near your battle station.  For example, torpedomen usually stood watch, worked, slept and had their battle stations in the torpedo rooms.
    
    In addition, sailors typically had plenty of warning during the war that the captain was planning to attack.  Smoke from potential targets could be spotted at least ten or fifteen miles away.  Smoke would be seen well before the ships themselves.  If the target would be cargo ships or tankers, which usually proceeded at 10 to 12 knots, the tracking party would be called away first.  That could be an hour or more before going to battle stations.
    
    In addition, there are very few secrets on a submarine.  There is barely enough room for a private thought, much less a secret.  Word about a possible attack would spread through the crew quickly.  Sailors would then have plenty of opportunity to drift toward their battle stations before the alarm would be sounded.
