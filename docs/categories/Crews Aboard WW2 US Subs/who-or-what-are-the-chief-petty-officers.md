=== "Detailed Answer"
    Chiefs, as they are known and addressed, are the senior enlisted on the boat.  They are specialists in their ratings and are experienced leaders.  They are often referred to as the backbone of the Navy and are generally acknowledged to be the people who enable its functioning.  There would be five or six chiefs assigned to the boat.

    The chiefs’ quarters are in the forward battery compartment, across from the ship’s office.  This space is referred to as the goat locker.  (This naming is true of the entire Navy, not just submarines.)  The space is so named because the chiefs are the “old goats” of the Navy.  In WW2, they were as old as 28 or 30 years old.

    In modern parlance, GOAT means the greatest of all time.  Most chiefs recognize that would be a bit of an exaggeration when referring to the goat locker.
