# What were some examples of the worst attacks?

=== "Short Answer"
    Puffer’s 38‑hour pounding, Salmon’s near‑fatal damage-and-surface fight, Sculpin’s loss under destroyer attack, and Halibut’s crippling depth‑charge damage were among the fiercest actions—plus Pampanito’s first‑patrol ordeal.
=== "Detailed Answer"
    Several actions stand out for intensity and damage:

    • USS Puffer (late 1943, 1st patrol): After hitting a tanker, Puffer was hunted by skilled sub‑chasers, held down for nearly 38 hours,
      pushed to ~500 ft with ~125°F heat, hypoxia, and failing systems before a risky night surface escape.

    • USS Salmon (Oct 1944): After attacking a guarded tanker, Salmon endured severe depth‑charging that jammed gear, flooded induction,
      blew open hatches, and drove her beyond test depth (~578 ft reported). Forced to surface, she charged an escort at ~50 yards,
      raked it with guns, dodged others, hid in weather, and was escorted home; later deemed too damaged for combat service.

    • USS Sculpin (Nov 1943): Detected by destroyer Yamagumo, damaged in repeated attacks, and forced to surface for a gun duel;
      bridge hits killed senior officers. The decision to scuttle followed. Captain John Cromwell, aboard as a wolfpack commander,
      chose to go down with the ship to protect ULTRA secrets and was awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously.

    • USS Halibut (Nov 1944): Likely found by a MAD‑equipped aircraft then savaged by coordinated escorts. Conning tower dished in,
      valves and instruments failed, periscope wrecked, high‑pressure air mishap over‑pressurized the battery compartment,
      and the deck gun was ruined. She survived and reached port but was later stricken as too damaged to repair.

    • USS Pampanito (1st patrol, 1944): After an escorted convoy attack and counter‑attack, a cracked induction made loud noise and
      flooded about 15 tons of water, forcing extreme depth and careful, quiet control until repairs could be improvised—from inside the pipe.
