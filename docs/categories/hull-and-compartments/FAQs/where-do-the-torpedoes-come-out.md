# Where do the torpedoes come out?

=== "Short Answer"
    The outer doors for the forward tubes are all the way forward and just below the first row of limber holes.
=== "Detailed Answer"
    The outer doors for the forward tubes are all the way forward and just below the first row of limber holes.  It is a rectangular structure that moves in toward the boat when opened.  The same is true of the after tubes although there are no limber holes near the after outer doors.



    The outer doors for the top tubes, both forward and aft are visible on the Pampanito.  You can see the outline of the rectangular doors.  That is because the boat is currently much lighter than it was when it was operational.  It does not have the 100 tons of battery cells, the nearly 400 tons of fuel, the full complement of torpedoes with live warheads, the food for the crew plus the 80 sailors and their gear.  If that were all on board, the boat would be sitting deeper in the water and the torpedo doors would be under water.
