# Is that an ice cream machine in the crew’s berthing?


=== "Short Answer"
    Yes, it is. Early in the war, there was no capacity to make ice cream on submarines. The boats may have been able to take small amounts with them on patrol, but there is little freezer space for up to 75 days at sea.

=== "Detailed Answer"
    Yes, it is.  Early in the war, there was no capacity to make ice cream on submarines.  The boats may have been able to take small amounts with them on patrol, but there is little freezer space for up to 75 days at sea.  Ice cream and oranges were the first things that sailors wanted when they returned from patrol.

    However, Pampanito has an ice cream machine.  It is not clear when it was installed, but it doesn’t seem likely that she had one when she was first built.  The first machine wasn’t installed on any submarine until the last half of ’43 and probably didn’t become standard equipment until ’44.

    The first ice cream machine on a US submarine was stolen.  It wasn’t stolen from the submarine.  It was stolen by the submarine.  While the USS Tang (SS-306) was in Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Dick O’Kane, the captain, let it be known that he wanted an ice cream machine.  It was not then standard equipment for submarines.  His comment was probably code for “make it happen and I probably don’t want to know how you did it.”  The crew found an ice cream machine, on a pier, due to be installed in the wardroom of the battleship USS Tennessee.  The crew “acquired” it and installed it in the pump room of the Tang.

    This story should sound too good to be true, a veritable “sea story”.  However, O’Kane made a reference to it in his book “Clear the Bridge” when he mentioned a forged receipt that was left for the Tennessee.

    After a war patrol, Admiral Lockwood, commander of submarines in the Central Pacific, came aboard for the usual patrol debrief.  When he was served ice cream, he commented that the Tang had gotten the ice cream aboard quickly.  O’Kane confessed that they had made the ice cream on board and showed Lockwood the machine.  The admiral thought that was a good idea, and ice cream machines became standard equipment on submarines.

    What flavors were available?  It seemed to be that you could have any flavor you wanted as long as it was white.
