=== "Short Answer"
    A ladder, in Navy speak, is a set of stairs or steps on a ship. Most of the original ladders on the Pampanito actually resemble the almost straight up and down ladders around your home. However, they were not as easily moved. Surface ships have ladders that look more like stairs.
