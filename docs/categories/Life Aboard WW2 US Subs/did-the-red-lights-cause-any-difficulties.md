    No serious difficulties. It is a bit harder to see gauges and labels in red lights, but we get used to that quickly.
=== "Detailed Answer"
    No serious difficulties. It is a bit harder to see gauges and labels in red lights, but we get used to that quickly. The most famous issue is that it was briefly impossible to play cards. If you have a deck in true red light, the red numbers and spots (hearts and diamonds) completely disappear. Sub sailors are quite resourceful and quickly solved the problem. They outlined the hearts and diamonds, and repeated the numbers, in black. Soon there was a deck of cards printed for submarines. Google “submarine playing cards” at for examples of how they solved the problem.
