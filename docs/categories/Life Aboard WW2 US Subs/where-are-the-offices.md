=== "Detailed Answer"
    There are only the two offices on the boat. There is the Log Office, which is the tiny space in the Maneuvering Room for the Engineering Department. The ship’s office, for the Yeoman, is a bit larger and is located across from the Goat Locker in the Forward Battery. The captain’s cabin has a desk and a bit more storage, but isn’t really an office.
