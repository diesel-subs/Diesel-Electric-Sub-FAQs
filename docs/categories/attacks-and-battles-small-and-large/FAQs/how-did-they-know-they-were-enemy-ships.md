# How did they know they were enemy ships?

=== "Short Answer"
    Context, recognition manuals, and behavior—plus the operational reality that boats patrolled deep in enemy waters.
=== "Detailed Answer"
    Crews cross‑checked expected friendly movements and used recognition guides to compare silhouettes (bows, sterns, masts, funnels).
    Early in the war, friendly‑fire risks from aircraft and ships reinforced caution. Late in the war, U.S. subs were so numerous
    that skippers had to be even more careful not to engage another American submarine.
