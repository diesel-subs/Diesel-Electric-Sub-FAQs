# Did the captain get the fancy room with only one bunk?


=== "Short Answer"
    The captain did get the separate cabin all to himself, although it isn’t that fancy. It did allow a minimum of privacy, although there was only a curtain instead of a door. He did have his own desk as well as course and depth indicators.

=== "Detailed Answer"
    The captain did get the separate cabin all to himself, although it isn’t that fancy.  It did allow a minimum of privacy, although there was only a curtain instead of a door.  He did have his own desk as well as course and depth indicators.  It should also be noted that he would probably be awakened often, in accordance with his night orders.  He would want to know of any potential enemy contacts as soon as possible.  He would also want to know when the battery charge was completed and when the boat was prepared for the activities of the next day.  In peacetime, the captain would also want to know whenever any ship was expected to come within five miles of the boat.  He would expect to know what the OOD was doing to stay clear of the other ship.
