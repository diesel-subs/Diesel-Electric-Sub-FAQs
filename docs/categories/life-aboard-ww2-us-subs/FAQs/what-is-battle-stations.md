=== "Detailed Answer"
    Battle stations is the condition when the ship is expected to go into battle.  Every position is manned, usually by the best operators available.  Crew members not at a specific battle station would be available as reserves or for damage control.

    On submarines, there could be different assignments for battle stations surfaced, battle stations guns or just battle stations (which assumes attacking while submerged.)
