=== "Detailed Answer"
    The primary purpose was to protect night vision.  When going from white lights to darkness – in this case up on the Bridge or looking through the periscope – we are practically blind for 15 seconds or more.  We were sending men up to the Bridge in darkness.  We would prefer that they didn’t hurt themselves getting there.  When going from red lights to darkness, we usually avoid the time that we are completely blind.
    
    It also reduces the time to get full night vision.  Although some people claim that it takes hours to get our full night vision, we can get most of it in about 20 minutes if we come from white lights.  If, however, we come from red lights we get most of our night vision back in about 10 minutes.
    
    The lookouts in WW2 were looking for smoke on the horizon, usually the first indication of enemy ships.  There may not have been a moon up yet, or maybe the sky was clouded over.  They were looking for smoke in a dark, grey night.  We needed to give the lookouts the best chance of seeing enemy activity that we could.
    
    When getting ready for a watch on the Bridge, sailors would usually be given red glasses or goggles to help preserve their night vision.  This would prevent a stray flashlight or match from doing any damage to someone’s night vision.  However, all flashlights used in red-light spaces should have a red lens for the same reason.
    
    It also prevents white lights from giving away our location.  White lights can show a beam for a great distance.  If you remember the first 9/11 memorials in New York City, you know what this means.  The memorials were just lights shining up to the sky from where the towers had stood.  Those beams of light were visible for miles all around.  Submarines don’t want to show something like that.
