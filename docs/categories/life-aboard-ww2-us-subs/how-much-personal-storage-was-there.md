# How much personal storage was there?


=== "Short Answer"
    Not much. For the individual enlisted sailor, there was about one square foot of storage, plus whatever could fit between the springs and the mattress. Uniforms and cigarettes can be stored under the mattress. Officers had a bit more storage, but they also had to store some paperwork for themselves.
