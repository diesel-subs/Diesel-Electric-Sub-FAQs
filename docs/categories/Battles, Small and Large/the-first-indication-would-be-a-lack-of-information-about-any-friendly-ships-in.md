=== "Detailed Answer"
    Then it was a matter of identification. The US had books that described the known Japanese warships, merchant ships and tankers. Captains would use features such as the type of bow and stern, the types of masts and funnels to compare what was seen in the periscopes to what could be found in the book. Captains would be very familiar with the outlines of the Japanese warships, and that made identification faster and easier.
    One could also be more confident that it was an enemy ship if it was shooting at you.
    However, by the end of the war, we had sunk most of the Japanese merchant fleet. It then became easier to find another American submarine than it was a Japanese ship to attack. (The joke was that you could cross the South China Sea just stepping from one American periscope to another.) Obviously, more caution was needed then.
