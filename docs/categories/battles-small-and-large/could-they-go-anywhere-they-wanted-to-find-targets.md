=== "Short Answer"

=== "Detailed Answer"
    Definitely not.  Boats were assigned to specific areas, both for safety and coverage.  If you were outside your assigned area, you might be attacked by friendly forces who weren’t very good at distinguishing our submarines from the Japanese.  Or you might incorrectly identify another of our submarines and attack.  You might also miss shipping that was proceeding through your assigned area that the higher commanders assumed you would intercept.
