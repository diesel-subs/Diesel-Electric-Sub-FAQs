=== "Detailed Answer"
    There are four tables with three seats on each side. That means the Crew’s Mess seats 24, comfortably. The crew eats in sections, one third at a time. Given the crew size of 80 sailors, minus the officers who eat in the wardroom and the cook and mess cooks, that leaves 22 or so who need to be fed at each seating.
