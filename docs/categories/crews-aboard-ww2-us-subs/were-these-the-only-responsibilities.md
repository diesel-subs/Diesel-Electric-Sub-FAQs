=== "Short Answer"
    No. Everyone was responsible for their submarine qualifications, including the basics about the entire boat. This was particularly true of younger sailors reporting aboard their first boat. It was also true when reporting to a new assignment.

=== "Detailed Answer"
    No.  Everyone was responsible for their submarine qualifications, including the basics about the entire boat.  This was particularly true of younger sailors reporting aboard their first boat.  It was also true when reporting to a new assignment.  Boats could be slightly different and the new command had to ensure that sailors new to the command knew what they said they did.  Obviously, requalifying on a different boat would be fairly quick and easy.
    
    There may be training across similar ratings such as electronics or mechanicals.  In addition, it was the responsibility of everyone on board to help train and to mentor the newest submariners.
