# What kept you from falling out of your bunk in heavy seas?


=== "Short Answer"
    This was mostly up to you.

=== "Detailed Answer"
    This was mostly up to you.  Find a sleeping position that was spread out enough so that you wouldn’t be as likely to roll over unintentionally.  You may not get a very good night’s sleep but it is possible to sleep this way.

    In big storms, captains would sometimes go deep for 12 hours or so.  This would get the boat below most of the wave motion.  Then the crew would have some time to eat a meal and get some sleep before going back up on the surface to fight the storm.

    In very heavy seas, you may have to strap yourself into your bunk in order to stay put.
