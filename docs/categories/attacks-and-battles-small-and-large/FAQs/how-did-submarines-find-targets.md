# How did submarines find targets?

=== "Short Answer"
    They combined patrol search, wolfpack coordination, radio reports, ULTRA intelligence, sensors, and sometimes pure luck.
=== "Detailed Answer"
    Captains patrolled assigned areas using experience, shared patrol reports, and general intelligence. Boats broadcast sightings
    to help others set up intercepts. From fall 1943, wolfpacks coordinated routes and attacks. ULTRA/“Magic” decrypts sometimes
    cued intercepts. Radar/sonar, smoke on the horizon, and even circling aircraft patterns could hint at convoys—though radar was
    used sparingly to avoid detection. Luck always played a role.
