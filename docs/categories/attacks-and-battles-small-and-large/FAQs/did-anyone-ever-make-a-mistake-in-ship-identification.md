# Did anyone ever make a mistake in ship identification?

=== "Short Answer"
    Yes—misclassifications were common; rare tragedies included friendly‑fire and even sinking a Russian hospital ship by mistake.
=== "Detailed Answer"
    Misidentifications—e.g., cruiser vs. battleship, destroyer vs. cruiser, or overstated tonnage—happened under stress and poor visibility.
    Friendly‑fire incidents occurred, particularly early in the war. In one grave case, an American submarine misidentified and sank a
    Russian hospital ship in fog; the CO lost his command.
