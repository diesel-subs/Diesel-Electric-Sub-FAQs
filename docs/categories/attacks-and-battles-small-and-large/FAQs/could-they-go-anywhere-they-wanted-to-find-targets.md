# Could they go anywhere they wanted to find targets?

=== "Short Answer"
    No. Boats were assigned patrol areas for safety and coverage; straying risked friendlyâ€‘fire and missed responsibilities.
=== "Detailed Answer"
    Submarines operated within assigned sectors to prevent fratricide and ensure coverage. Operating outside your sector increased
    the risk of being misidentified by friendly forces or misidentifying another U.S. submarine, and it could leave gaps where
    higher command expected you to interdict traffic.
