# How many torpedo hits would it take to sink a ship?

=== "Short Answer"
    It varied widely—by ship type, condition, load, and hit location. Some sank from one hit; others took several or even duds did damage.
=== "Detailed Answer"
    Examples: Battleship Kongō fell to three hits from six fired by USS Sealion (Nov 1944). Carrier Taihō exploded after one hit by Albacore,
    when gasoline fumes ignited due to poor damage control. Destroyers might be killed by a single hit in “down‑the‑throat” shots. Ammunition
    ships could detonate catastrophically; gasoline tankers might explode, while crude‑oil tankers could be stubborn unless fires started.
    Salmon even sank an old ship with a dud that holed the hull. Rakuyō Maru, carrying raw rubber, sank slowly as the cargo absorbed the blast.
