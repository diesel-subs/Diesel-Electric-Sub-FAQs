# Is a submarine a boat or a ship?

    
=== "Short Answer"
  By size-based definitions, submarines like Pampanito qualify as ships (they're too large to be carried).

=== "Detailed Answer"
    By size-based definitions, submarines like Pampanito qualify as ships (they're too large to be carried). Early submarines, however, were truly 'boats'—carried to the fight and not suited for long ocean transits. By tradition, all submarines are still called 'boats' even though modern ones are huge. In practice, you’ll hear both terms, with 'boat' being far more common among submariners.
