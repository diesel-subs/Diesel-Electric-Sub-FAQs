# Was there a doctor on board these submarines?


=== "Short Answer"
    No, there were no doctors on our submarines in WW2. The “docs”, as they were always called, were medics. These medics, called pharmacist mates at the time, were specially trained and qualified for independent duty and they were very good. They understood the art of medicine as well as the science.

    Pampanito did have a doctor on board briefly.  On her third war patrol, when she was headed to Saipan with the rescued British and Australian soldiers, she was met by a destroyer.  A doctor and another pharmacist mate were transferred to the boat to help with the weaker soldiers.  Unfortunately, the doctor appears to have spent most of his time doing paperwork and complaining that Pampanito didn’t have enough fresh citrus fruit on board to prevent scurvy.

    There are still no doctors on our attack submarines.  The large missile boats are the only US subs with doctors on board at this time.
