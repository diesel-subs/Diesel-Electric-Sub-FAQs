=== "Summary"
    The biggest difference was that there were few reserve officers at the beginning of the war. Reserve officers were looked upon with some skepticism, particularly early on. However, they proved themselves to be capable officers and the submarine war would have been much less effective without them.
=== "Detailed Answer"
    The biggest difference was that there were few reserve officers at the beginning of the war.  Reserve officers were looked upon with some skepticism, particularly early on.  However, they proved themselves to be capable officers and the submarine war would have been much less effective without them.  It appears that nearly all submarine commanders were regular officers with most being Naval Academy graduates.  It was late 1944 before the first reserve officer would command a submarine in WW2
