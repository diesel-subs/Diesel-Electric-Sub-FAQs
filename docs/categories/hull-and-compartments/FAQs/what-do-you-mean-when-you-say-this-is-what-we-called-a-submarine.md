    In the early 1940s, technology limited these boats to being submersibles: surface ships that could submerge for relatively brief periods (usually about 16 hours), fight submerged, and then surface again. The first true submarine was USS Nautilus (SSN‑571), commissioned in 1954. With nuclear power she could operate underwater for months without surfacing to breathe air or recharge batteries, and she was designed to remain submerged the vast majority of the time.
