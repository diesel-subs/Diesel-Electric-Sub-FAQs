# When were the meals?


=== "Short Answer"
    Meals were tied to the changes of the watch. That means breakfast was at 08:00, lunch was at noon, soup down was at 16:00 and dinner at 20:00. This is done so that no one needs to miss a meal. The watch section which will be going on duty eats first.

=== "Detailed Answer"
    Meals were tied to the changes of the watch.  That means breakfast was at 08:00, lunch was at noon, soup down was at 16:00 and dinner at 20:00.  This is done so that no one needs to miss a meal.  The watch section which will be going on duty eats first.  During the time that the watch changes, the section not involved eats next.  (The change of the watch is not instantaneous.  The section coming on watch needs to be told about the current situation and any upcoming changes or expected operations.)  The section coming off watch eats last.
