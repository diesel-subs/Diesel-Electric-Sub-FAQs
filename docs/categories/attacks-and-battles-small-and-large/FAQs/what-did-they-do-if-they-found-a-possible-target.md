# What did they do if they found a possible target?

=== "Short Answer"
    Point at it, alert the captain, get ahead of the target, then form a tracking party and go to battle stations if attack was feasible.
=== "Detailed Answer"
    The Officer of the Deck would first steer toward the contact and alert the captain. The captain would judge relative motion and
    maneuver to gain an ahead position. If attack looked possible, the tracking party assembled to refine the solution; when in
    range, the crew went to battle stations for the strike.
