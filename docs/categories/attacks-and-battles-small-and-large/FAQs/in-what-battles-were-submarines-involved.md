# In what battles were submarines involved?

=== "Short Answer"
    Submarines participated around most major WW2 naval battles—often as scouts, lifeguards, and convoy raiders—rather than mixing into the main gun/air clashes.
=== "Detailed Answer"
    Submarines generally avoided the center of large surface actions—being in the middle of a battleship and carrier melee
    was a bit like a dog in a bison stampede. Instead, they contributed on the edges: reporting enemy positions, attacking
    before or after fleet engagements, interdicting supply and troop convoys, and standing lifeguard duty for downed aircrews.

    Examples noted in the record include:
    • Battle of Savo Island (Solomons): S‑44 sank the Japanese heavy cruiser Kako during the Japanese withdrawal.
    • Midway: A picket arc of U.S. subs helped locate Japanese forces. Nautilus’ contact with a destroyer helped U.S. carrier aircraft
      infer the carriers’ location. Later torpedo attempts by Nautilus saw misfires/duds—early signs of Mark 14 reliability issues.
    • Philippine Sea (“Great Marianas Turkey Shoot”): U.S. subs provided crucial scouting and logistics interdiction and sank two carriers—
      Albacore sank Taihō (helped by catastrophic Japanese damage-control mistakes) and Cavalla sank Shōkaku after multiple hits.
    • Leyte Gulf: Darter and Dace ambushed part of the Japanese Center Force, sinking Atago and Maya and crippling Takao; other boats
      scouted, harassed, and attempted attacks around the sprawling action.
