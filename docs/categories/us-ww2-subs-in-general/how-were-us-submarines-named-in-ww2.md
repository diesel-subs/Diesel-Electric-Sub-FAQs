# How were US submarines named in WW2?


=== "Short Answer"
    Submarines were named after sea creatures. We can’t just say they were named after fish although most were, such as the Perch, Bullhead, Cod, Flying Fish and Halibut. However, some were named after marine mammals such as the Whale, Porpoise, Finback (a whale), Sea Cat (an otter) and Sealion.

    Submarines were named after sea creatures.  We can’t just say they were named after fish although most were, such as the Perch, Bullhead, Cod, Flying Fish and Halibut.  However, some were named after marine mammals such as the Whale, Porpoise, Finback (a whale), Sea Cat (an otter) and Sealion.  Others were named after unusual sea creatures, such as the Seahorse and Skate.  Obviously, not all could be named after ferocious sea creatures such as sharks or piranhas.  We even named subs the Seadragon and the Trepang, which are nudibranchs or sea slugs.

    The Pampanito is named after a smaller version of the pompano fish.  Pampanito, the fish, is about a foot long.  It is a rather mild-mannered fish that is brown or black on top and silver underneath.
