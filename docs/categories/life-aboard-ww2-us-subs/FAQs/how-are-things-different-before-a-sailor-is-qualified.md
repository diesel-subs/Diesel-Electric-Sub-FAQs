=== "Detailed Answer"
    When you report aboard your first submarine you are a non-qualified puke (NQP), a life form just below pond scum.  Another version of this is that you are a useless food-consuming being (UFB).

    The main point is that you have a great deal of work to do before you are a qualified submariner.  You are expected to spend your spare time working on your quals.
