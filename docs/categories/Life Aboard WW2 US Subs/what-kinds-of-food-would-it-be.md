=== "Detailed Answer"
    The menu was fairly basic.  You were trying to keep 80 men happy even though they were from different regions of the country with different cuisines.  Meat, potatoes and vegetable were the basic menus.  That would vary some with pasta and rice being on the menu at times.  Fresh bread or rolls were normal.  In addition, the overnight baker may have made pies or cakes.

    After the first week at sea, there would be little fresh fruit, vegetables or salads.  Fresh food doesn’t last that long, particularly with limited cold storage.  Cheese and fresh eggs didn’t last long either.  Eggs would then be powdered after that.  Much of the meat would be frozen or canned.
