# What is the tracking party?

=== "Short Answer"
    A team that logs, plots, and continuously refines the firing solutionâ€”centered on the Torpedo Data Computer (TDC).
=== "Detailed Answer"
    The tracking party recorded observations, plotted target motion relative to own ship, and operated the TDC. Beyond computing final
    torpedo gyro angles, the TDC provided a running solution that guided maneuvering and timing during the approach.
