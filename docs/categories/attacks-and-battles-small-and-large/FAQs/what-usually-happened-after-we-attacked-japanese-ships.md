# What usually happened after we attacked Japanese ships?

=== "Short Answer"
    Counter‑attacks ranged from aimless depth‑charging to ferocious, prolonged hunts—52 U.S. subs were lost in the war.
=== "Detailed Answer"
    Sometimes escorts dropped depth charges indiscriminately to deter further attacks. Other times, coordinated and persistent ASW efforts
    inflicted serious damage or losses; at least 27 U.S. subs were lost to enemy ASW forces out of 52 wartime losses overall.
