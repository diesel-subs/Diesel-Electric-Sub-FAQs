# Do you feel the motion when you are submerged?


=== "Short Answer"
    Yes, but it quickly gets to be at a lesser amount. Down at 100 to 150 feet, the wave motion from the typical swells is mostly or completely gone. The boat is much steadier. However, you probably will be aware of up and down angles during larger changes in depth.

=== "Detailed Answer"
    Yes, but it quickly gets to be at a lesser amount.  Down at 100 to 150 feet, the wave motion from the typical swells is mostly or completely gone.  The boat is much steadier.  However, you probably will be aware of up and down angles during larger changes in depth.  Those are due to operation of the boat and are separate from wave action.

    Shortly after leaving port, the captain will usually do “angles and dangles.”  This is normally announced in advance.  The captain would then order depth changes with larger up and down angles.  This is done to shake loose any equipment and supplies that aren’t stored properly.  This provides an opportunity to store everything properly before it can become a problem.
