=== "Summary"
    Traditionally, everyone aboard a U. S. submarine is a volunteer.
=== "Detailed Answer"
    Traditionally, everyone aboard a U. S. submarine is a volunteer.  That has almost always been the case.  The exception was early in WW2 when the submarine force needed to expand quickly.  Some sub sailors at that time didn’t remember when they volunteered.  (We like to say that they didn’t back up quickly enough when volunteers were asked for or that they were “voluntold.”)

    However, if you don’t want to be on a submarine, you don’t have to.  We probably don’t want you to be aboard if you aren’t comfortable there.  You can always request to “non-vol”, even if you volunteered in the first place.  Being at sea in such close quarters and submerged for so much time can be very different from just a training dive or two.  It might be much more uncomfortable than you imagined.  The Navy can always find another place for a quality, competent sailor to serve.
