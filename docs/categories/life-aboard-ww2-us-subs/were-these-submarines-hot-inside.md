=== "Short Answer"
    Most of them were, but that depended on where they were. If they were in the tropics, we suspect that the boats were rarely if ever below 90 degrees. And most of our boats were in the tropics for the majority of the time.

=== "Detailed Answer"
    Most of them were, but that depended on where they were.  If they were in the tropics, we suspect that the boats were rarely if ever below 90 degrees.  And most of our boats were in the tropics for the majority of the time.  The first issue is that the water temperature is 80 to 85 degrees.  The next one is that the boat is constantly generating heat mainly from cooking, the engines and from charging or discharging the battery.  In the tropics, the engine rooms would easily reach 100 degrees.
    
    When the engines were shut down when submerging, the cooling water to the engines would also shut down.  Then the engine rooms could reach 120 degrees and the rest of the boat could be 110.  It would take some time for the warm ocean waters to cool the boat back down.
    
    There is air conditioning, but it was really little more than a dehumidifier.  Freidman, Page 200.  It helped but didn’t really cool the boat that much.
    
    If the boats were in northern or southern latitudes, the temperatures could be more moderate.  This was particularly true in spring and fall.
    
    If the boats were operating off Alaska, they might actually be rather cold.  The Japanese occupied the last two islands in the Aleutian chain at the time of the Battle of Midway.  After that, we often had a submarine in the area monitoring any Japanese activity.  In that area, the air and water temperatures may well be in the low 30s.  If so, the boat would be cool or cold.  The crew might be wishing for some of that excess tropical heat.  It would also be cold in the boats during the winter if they were being tested during sea trials off Manitowoc, WI; Portsmouth, NH; or New London, CT.
    
    Weren’t the boats crowded?
    Submariners didn’t usually think so.  No one thought a submarine would be spacious when they volunteered.  They knew it was small and would be all closed up when submerged.  (The non-submarine admirals who complained that the new designs were too plush seemed to think otherwise.)  Therefore, the boats did not seem that crowded to the crews.
    
    NOTE: We sometimes point out that conditions on these submarines do not meet the minimum standards for U. S. prisons.  Most of that is simply due to the lack of space per person and the fact that many of the crew will not see daylight for weeks.  Some may not even see the sky at night.  However, to be fair, conditions on most surface ships aren’t that much better.
    
    Still, it’s really a matter of what you get used to and the crews quickly became accustomed to the conditions.  It simply became the new normal.  As Fletcher Pratt wrote about submariners in “The Navy’s War”, page 140: “It was a club of individuals with an almost incredible ability to treat every circumstance as normal.”

    Even though the crew could become accustomed to the close quarters, that didn’t make it ideal.  Of course, carrying a significant number of extra passengers, such as rescued personnel or special operations troops would make it more crowded.  The crew might have to work a bit harder to make it seem normal.
    
    There are showers on board.  How often could the crew take showers?
    Rarely, if ever.  On a submarine, there isn’t enough fresh water for everyone to take showers regularly.  This varied from boat to boat, but the stills only produced so much fresh water.  They were also famously unreliable.  If both stills were working at full capacity, they would produce about 5,000 gallons per week each.  They were rarely both working at capacity and, in the patrol area, you would not use the stills when submerged.  They use too much power and make too much noise.
    
    The first 500 gallons each week has to be distilled twice for the battery.  The next claim for fresh water is the internal cooling systems for the engines.  However, the engines don’t normally require much water each week.  The next claim would be by the cooks.  Water is needed for coffee or bug juice (a sort of Kool-Aid), to cook your food and to wash the dishes.  That leaves only a few gallons per day for the crew to brush their teeth, shave if they want to, and wash up a bit.
    
    We would like to have the cooks and the pharmacist mate (medic) shower about once a week.  With so little water left after that, the rest of the crew would not normally take showers.  They might only get a bucket of water periodically from the air conditioning condensate to wash out skivvies and then take a sponge bath.  Since that water is extracted from the air in the boat, it will almost certainly have a thin sheen of oil on top.
    
    Any showers would be “navy showers”.  Fresh water is precious throughout the fleet, even where it is more plentiful than it was on submarines.  A navy shower means that the sailor wets down and then turns the water off.  He or she then soaps and lathers up.  Then the water is turned back on to rinse off.  Ideally, the total water usage is no more than three minutes.
    
    San Francisco residents tend to use water efficiently and that is still about 60 gallons per day.  That would be over 5,000 gallons per day for 80 people plus the water needed for the battery.  Submarines often didn’t make that much water in a week.
