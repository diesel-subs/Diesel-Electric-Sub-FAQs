=== "Detailed Answer"
    This would depend on what type of ship the target is.  Generally, the larger the ship, the more torpedoes that would be used.  The more armored the ship, the more torpedoes that would be needed.  If the target is pointed right at you, such as a destroyer or other escort, you would likely only fire one at a time if you dared the shot at all.

    Carriers and battleships would rate all six torpedoes if firing from the Forward Torpedo Room or all four from the After Torpedo Room.  Destroyers might rate two or three.  Cruisers and large cargo ships and tankers might rate three or four.  Smaller cargo ships might rate only two.
