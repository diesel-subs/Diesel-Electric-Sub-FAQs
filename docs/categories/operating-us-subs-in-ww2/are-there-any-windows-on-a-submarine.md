=== "Short Answer"
    This may seem to be a laughable question. However, it isn’t like asking about screen doors on a submarine, which there obviously aren’t. After all, it looks to many people as though there are a whole series of windows along the side of the boat.

=== "Detailed Answer"
    This may seem to be a laughable question.  However, it isn’t like asking about screen doors on a submarine, which there obviously aren’t.  After all, it looks to many people as though there are a whole series of windows along the side of the boat.  Those are actually limber holes, not windows, and they are discussed under “Diving, Surfacing and Buoyancy.”
    
    In fact, there is just one small window on the Pampanito.  (This is in addition to the periscopes.)  It is located in the control room at the Chief of the Watch station.  Near the Christmas tree, in the forward port corner, there is a safe and a ladder above it leading up to a hatch.  That hatch has a small window in it, about two inches in diameter.  The purpose of the window is to let the gun crews know when the water has cleared enough to be able to open the hatch safely and head up on deck.
