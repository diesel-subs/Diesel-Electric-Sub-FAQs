# "What is a trim dive?"

  === "Short Answer"

      The actual weight of the submarine matters a great deal when it is submerged. If it is too light, it will tend to rise and broach the surface.

  === "Detailed Answer"

          The actual weight of the submarine matters a great deal when it is submerged.  If it is too light, it will tend to rise and broach the surface.  If it is too heavy, it will tend to go deeper, possibly to unsafe depths.  Therefore, we work to keep the boat in neutral trim which is safer and makes depth control easier.  We want to weigh the same as the water we displace.

          

          The challenge is that the weight of an operating submarine is constantly changing.  Consuming food and using supplies make the boat lighter.  Burning fuel makes the boat heavier.  (See the section on diving and surfacing the submarine.)  Changes in the temperature or salinity of the water can make the boat seem heavier or lighter.

          

          As a result, at least once each day, the submarine will be submerged so that the Diving Officer can get the boat back into neutral trim.  That is the trim dive.  It probably takes no more than 10 or 15 minutes.  Once the boat is back in trim, it can be surfaced and previous operations resumed.  Trim dives were most common during lengthy transits from one location to another.
