=== "Detailed Answer"
    The tracking party is the part of the battle stations crew that is determining the location and direction of the potential targets while still a distance away.  This could be an hour or more before the rest of the crew went to battle stations, depending on the speed of the targets.  The information gathered at this time would eventually be the basis for the attack and the final course of the torpedoes.

    The captain and executive officer were key members, of course.  You would also want the sonar and radar stations manned by your best people.  The torpedo data computer (TDC) would be used to track the targets’ progress and to begin to develop the firing solution for the torpedoes.  Therefore, the TDC operator(s) would be included, along with anyone else the captain deemed relevant.
