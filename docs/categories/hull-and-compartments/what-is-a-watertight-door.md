# What is a “watertight door”?


=== "Short Answer"
    A watertight door is the opening between the compartments on a submarine. The doors are very heavy since they are designed to withstand sea pressure. This is so they can prevent flooding from moving from one compartment to the next. At a depth of 400 feet, the outside water pressure is about 175 PSI.

=== "Detailed Answer"
    A watertight door is the opening between the compartments on a submarine.  The doors are very heavy since they are designed to withstand sea pressure.  This is so they can prevent flooding from moving from one compartment to the next.  At a depth of 400 feet, the outside water pressure is about 175 PSI.  The weight needed to withstand that pressure helps to explain their small size.

    There are no watertight doors on the lower level.  To go from one compartment to the next on that level, one would have to go up to the main level, move to the desired compartment, and then go back down.
