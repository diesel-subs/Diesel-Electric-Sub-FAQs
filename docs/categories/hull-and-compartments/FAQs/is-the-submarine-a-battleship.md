# Is the submarine a battleship?

    
=== "Short Answer"
  No, not in the WW2 sense.

=== "Detailed Answer"
    No, not in the WW2 sense. Submarines fought in battles, but a 'battleship' was a specific class: very large, heavily armored ships with many guns—up to nine 16‑inch guns, scores of 5‑inch, 40 mm, and 20 mm mounts. U.S. battleships displaced roughly 25× Pampanito’s weight. Submarines are combatant ships, but they are not battleships.
