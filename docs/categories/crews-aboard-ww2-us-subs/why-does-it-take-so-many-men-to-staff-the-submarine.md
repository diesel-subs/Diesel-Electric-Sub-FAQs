# Why does it take so many men to staff the submarine?


=== "Short Answer"
    On the surface at sea, there were a number of jobs to do and there would be one person awake in each compartment to monitor the space for problems or danger. For example, on the surface there would be

The officer of the deck with three or four lookouts on the bridge.

=== "Detailed Answer"
    On the surface at sea, there were a number of jobs to do and there would be one person awake in each compartment to monitor the space for problems or danger.  For example, on the surface there would be

    The officer of the deck with three or four lookouts on the bridge.

    A helmsman, quartermaster (navigation) along with the sonar and radar operators in the conning tower.

    The Chief of the Watch plus an IC electrician and a messenger in the control room.

    A radar operator for the air search and IFF equipment.

    A radioman on watch in the radio room.

    Two electrician mates in maneuvering.

    A motor machinist mate (engineman) and an oiler in each engine room.

    Normally there would be a cook in the crew’s mess.  There would often be a mess cook there too.

    A steward mate in the forward battery.

    A torpedoman on watch in each torpedo room.

    There are other duties, such as an electrician monitoring the battery, particularly during a charge.

    A gunner’s mate to maintain the guns

    This is a total of about 24 per shift, and there are three shifts.

    When submerged, the duties for some of these men would change.  For example, the officer of the deck (OOD) will become the diving officer and there would be a new OOD in the conning tower.  The oilers in the engine rooms will man the trim manifold and air manifold in the control room.  The lookouts would man the bow and stern planes.  In total, you will need about the same number of men when submerged as on the surface.

    You need to have additional personnel on board to allow for trainees, injuries and illness.  Gun crews will also need to be staffed during battle stations.  In addition to these functions, there are the captain, the XO, the yeoman and pharmacist mate who generally aren’t on the watch list.  The yeoman and the pharmacist mate might stand some watches as their primary duties permit.
