=== "Detailed Answer"
    We lost a total of 52 submarines from all causes or about 23%.  We lost about 3,500 submarine sailors with their boats.  This was the highest loss rate of any of the major American services during the war.  (However, some of the smaller units, such as the Eighth Air Force over Europe, may have had a higher loss rate.)  As bad as this loss rate was for our boats, most other countries lost a higher percentage of their submarines
