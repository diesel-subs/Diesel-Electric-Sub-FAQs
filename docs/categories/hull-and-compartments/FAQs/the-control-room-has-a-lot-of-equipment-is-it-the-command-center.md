# The control room has a lot of equipment. Is it the command center?

    
=== "Short Answer"
  Despite its equipment, the control room is not the command center.

=== "Detailed Answer"
    Despite its equipment, the control room is not the command center. Submerged, command shifts to the conning tower—always manned at sea by helmsman and quartermaster, with radar and sonar typically operated there. During battle stations for submerged attacks it could hold 10–12 men. The conning tower is about 20 feet long and 10 feet in diameter, with slightly thicker steel because it sits closer to the surface. When surfaced, the bridge is the command center; the Officer of the Deck is topside, supported by teams in the conning tower and control room (especially during surface attacks).
