=== "Summary"
    Yes, it has a lot of equipment. No, it is not the command center.
=== "Detailed Answer"
    Yes, it has a lot of equipment.  No, it is not the command center.  That would be either the conning tower, which is above the control room, or the bridge.  The conning tower is the command center when the boat is submerged.  It is always manned when at sea by a helmsman and quartermaster since steering and navigation are normally done from this space.  Radar and sonar are also normally operated from this space.  It would be very crowded during general quarters (battle stations) for submerged attacks with as many as 10 to 12 men in the space.
    
    The conning tower is only about 20 feet long and 10 feet in diameter.  It is made of slightly thicker steel due to its vulnerability since it is closer to the surface.
    
    The bridge is the command center, where the officer of the deck will normally be, when surfaced.  When on the surface, the officer of the deck is supported by the crewmen in the conning tower and control room.  This is particularly true when attacking on the surface.
    
    Are there enough heads on the boat?  We only see two.
    
    There are four heads on the Pampanito.  Two are in the main berthing area.  They have metal doors and are opposite the washing machine.  There is one additional head in each of the torpedo rooms.  And, yes, four heads are normally enough for the 80-man crew.
