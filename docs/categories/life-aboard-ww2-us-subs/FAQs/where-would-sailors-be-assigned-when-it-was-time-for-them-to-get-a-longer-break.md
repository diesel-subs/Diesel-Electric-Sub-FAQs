=== "Detailed Answer"
    The crewmen who were being rotated off the boat could be assigned to any number of duties.  One of the most common would be to new construction.  Submarines in the latter stages of being finished needed many experienced crewmen.  The men coming off combat would help finish the new boat and provide the experienced core of the new crew.  This way, they would also get a few months break from combat while the new boat is completed and then undergoes sea trials, post-construction repairs, training and then the transit to their new homeport.

    Other possibilities for assignments included training billets, division or squadron staff or relief crews.  Relief crews were the experienced sailors who would take over for the first two weeks for boats coming off patrol.  They started or assisted with repairs and upgrading equipment as needed.  They were fully responsible for the boat so that the crew could get the full two weeks off.  However, the commanding officer, executive officer and senior department heads would often monitor the work being done on the boat even during that two-week-off period.

    After about six war patrols, submarines were given an overhaul.  Overhauls were extended maintenance periods for larger repairs and the installation training for new equipment.  The hull might be cleaned for better speed.  It could also be repainted.  This would often be back on the West Coast so the added transit time is also part of the longer break between patrols.
