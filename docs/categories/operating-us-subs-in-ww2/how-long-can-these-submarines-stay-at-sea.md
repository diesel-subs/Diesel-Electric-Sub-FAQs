=== "Short Answer"
    The primary limitations are food and fuel. Other things like spare parts can become an issue, but that would be an unusual case. Hopefully, running out of torpedoes is a good thing, assuming they hit targets, and aren’t part of this question.

    Food is loaded out for the expected duration of the patrol, up to 75 days.  A few patrols went a bit over 80 days.  That requires creativity by the cooks and patience by the crew.  The menus for the last few days would likely be strange combinations of whatever is still left on board.
    
    Fuel is the most frequent limitation.  These submarines can carry up to 110,000 gallons of diesel fuel.  The question then is how efficiently is it being used.  A boat may have to run at higher, inefficient speeds to be in a newly assigned area.  A boat may have had targets make an unexpected course change and get away.  In that case, the boat may choose to make a high-speed “end-around” to get in front of the targets again.  These are all appropriate uses of fuel, but they are less efficient.  As a result, the fuel may not last as long as planned.
