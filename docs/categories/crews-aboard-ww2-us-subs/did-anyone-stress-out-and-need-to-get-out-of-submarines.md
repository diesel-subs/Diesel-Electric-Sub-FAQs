=== "Detailed Answer"
    During the war, there are a few instances of sailors stressing out when under attack.  However, they were surprisingly few considering the stress of being depth charged.

    In a few cases, the sailor might start yelling or trying to open a hatch to get out.  In these cases, he would be forcibly subdued and then sedated.  He might have to be knocked unconscious to render him quiet.  He would usually remain sedated until returning to port.  In a few other cases, the sailors froze and became very withdrawn, almost catatonic.  In those cases, they might simply be relieved of their duties and replaced.

    Sailors almost never stressed out just by being submerged.  There are very few, if any, cases like this in the literature.  After all, you had volunteered to be under water.  If you thought there was any chance you might be claustrophobic, you werenâ€™t likely to volunteer for submarines.
