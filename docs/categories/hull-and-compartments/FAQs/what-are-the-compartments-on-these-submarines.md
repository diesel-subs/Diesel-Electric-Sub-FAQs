  - **After Engine Room:** Two Fairbanks‑Morse 10‑cyl opposed‑piston main diesels (~1,500 hp each) with generators; a smaller 7‑cyl 'donkey' diesel (removed from active boats in the 1950s); clean fuel and normal lube‑oil tanks; pumps and filters.
  - **Forward Engine Room:** Two more main diesel‑generator sets; two Kleinschmidt stills (fresh water); lower‑level air‑conditioning/dehumidification; clean fuel and normal lube‑oil tanks; pumps/filters.
