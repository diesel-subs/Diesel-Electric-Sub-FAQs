    The main things that WW2 medics would treat would be minor injuries, a few broken bones, skin rashes, etc. A few needed to treat bullet wounds from surface attacks with guns; the enemy did tend to shoot back. There would probably be a few cases of venereal disease as well.

    Colds and flu were relatively uncommon on submarines during WW2.  Most sailors hadnâ€™t had a chance to go home and be exposed to children who tend to spread such illnesses.  If there was a cold or flu on board, it would probably spread rapidly because of the close living conditions and then die out.

    They did not expect to treat men with tropical diseases like those of the rescued POWs.
