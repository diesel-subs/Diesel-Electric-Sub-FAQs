# Is there a best place to sleep?


=== "Short Answer"
    Submarines are relatively noisy at night.

=== "Detailed Answer"
    Submarines are relatively noisy at night.  Engines are running and batteries are being charged.  The boat is on the surface plowing through waves.  People are on watch, operating the submarine.  All of that makes noise.  Red lights help to make it easier to sleep, but the boat can’t go completely dark.  As a result, nothing will be as quiet and dark as your bedroom at home.

    Most areas seem to have advantages and drawbacks.  The forward torpedo room is farthest from the engines, so that noise is at the lowest level here.  However, you do hear the bow crashing through the waves.  In addition, the bow, as well as the stern, experience the most vertical motion - up and down - due to the swells of the ocean.

    The after torpedo room has a little separation from the engines but does have the propellor shafts running under it with the screws not far behind.  That does generate noise while on the surface.

    The after battery – crews’ berthing – will probably have the least vertical motion.  However, it is next to the forward engine room which will normally have at least one engine running at night.  It also has a large fan pulling air out of the battery well during the battery charge.  With 36 bunks in this space, the chances of at least one sailor snoring like a chain saw are close to 100%.

    NOTE: The area on the port side of the crew’s berthing, away from the main passageway, is usually a bit better.  There would normally be a divider of some sort between the 18 port side bunks and the other 18.  That area on the port side, called Hogan’s Alley, could then be a little darker and a bit quieter.

    The top bunks are usually preferred since no one would step on your bunk as they climb up to theirs.  Just watch out for all those little valves in the after corners of the crew’s berthing area.  You don’t want to wake up with a start and imprint those valves on your forehead.

    The forward battery is likely to be one of the better places to sleep.  There are still engine, fan and wave noises, as well as lights.  But this space doesn’t have the worst of any of the disadvantages.  The key may be to become an officer or a chief petty officer so you can have a bunk in this compartment.
