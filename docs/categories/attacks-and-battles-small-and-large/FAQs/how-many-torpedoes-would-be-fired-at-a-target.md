# How many torpedoes would be fired at a target?

=== "Short Answer"
    It depended on target type and aspect: big or armored ships meant more; single shots for head‑on escorts were common.
=== "Detailed Answer"
    Typical salvo sizes varied: carriers and battleships could merit all forward (six) or all aft (four) tubes; cruisers and large
    merchants often drew three to four; smaller freighters about two; “down‑the‑throat” shots at charging destroyers were usually singles.
