    The typical workday would be from 08:00 to 16:00. That could be started and ended earlier, called tropical hours, so that the crew isn’t working during the hottest part of the day.
=== "Detailed Answer"
    The typical workday would be from 08:00 to 16:00. That could be started and ended earlier, called tropical hours, so that the crew isn’t working during the hottest part of the day. However, in WW2 it was often longer than eight hours as men trained or got the boat ready for the next patrol.
    One third of the crew would remain on board overnight. This was so that there were enough men on board in case of emergencies and so the boat could get underway and change locations as needed. The duty section would likely have some work to do to continue repairs or to clean up after shipyard workers.
    This assumes that there are no major problems to be corrected. If, for example, engines needed to be overhauled, then the enginemen (motor macs in WW2) would work more hours. Others in the crew might be assigned to assist. The key thing is to get the boat ready for the next patrol. It is important to remember that sailors in the Pacific area did not go home at night. They may not see their families for a year or more at a time.
