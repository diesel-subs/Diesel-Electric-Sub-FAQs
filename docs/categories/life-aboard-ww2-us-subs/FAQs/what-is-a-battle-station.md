=== "Detailed Answer"
    It is an individual’s job when the submarine went into combat.  Some of the crew had different stations depending on whether the boat was attacking on the surface, preparing to use the deck guns, or submerged.  This would normally be related to one’s rating or specialty.  It could be as one of the primary operators or as a back-up or available for damage control.
