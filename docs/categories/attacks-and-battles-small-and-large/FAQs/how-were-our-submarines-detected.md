# How were our submarines detected?

=== "Short Answer"
    By radar/sonar, aircraft patrols (sometimes with MAD), radio/radar emissions, and torpedo bubble trails pointing back to the shooter.
=== "Detailed Answer"
    Japanese sensors could detect radar/radio transmissions; aircraft scouted common routes and convoys, occasionally catching subs on the surface
    or marking them for escorts. Steam torpedoes left conspicuous wakes that often revealed firing positions. Japanese sensor quality and upgrades
    lagged U.S./British efforts overall, but were still dangerous.
