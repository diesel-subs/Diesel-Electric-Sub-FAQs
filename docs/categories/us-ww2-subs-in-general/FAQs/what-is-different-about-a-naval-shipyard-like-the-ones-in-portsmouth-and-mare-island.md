=== "Detailed Answer"
    Naval shipyards are owned and operated by the government.  Costs for building ships are based on the total costs for labor, materials and overhead.  Civilian shipyards, such as Electric Boat and Manitowoc Shipbuilding, are profit making ventures.  They add a reasonable profit to their estimated costs when entering into a contract with the government.
