=== "Detailed Answer"
    Liberty was, and still is, time off for sailors when not on duty overnight or when visiting a port. Usually, one third of the crew will remain on board at all times so that the ship can get underway if needed during an emergency. The other two thirds may have liberty. Liberty is usually just overnight or over a weekend assuming the sailor isn’t part of a duty section. It is not time off counted against leave.
