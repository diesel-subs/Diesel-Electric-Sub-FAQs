    On the WW2 boats, it is often claimed that the only exercise the men got was jumping to conclusions or playfully harassing each other. The fact is that there wasn’t the room, and often not the time, for regular exercise.
=== "Detailed Answer"
    On the WW2 boats, it is often claimed that the only exercise the men got was jumping to conclusions or playfully harassing each other. The fact is that there wasn’t the room, and often not the time, for regular exercise. There was usually some work going on during the day in the few compartments with space. As a result, the only real exercise would come from whatever manual work you had to do or going up and down ladders.
