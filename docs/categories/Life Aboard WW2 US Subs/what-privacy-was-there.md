=== "Summary"
    Obviously very little. Even the captain, who had a stateroom to himself, didn’t have a door to close.
=== "Detailed Answer"
    Obviously very little. Even the captain, who had a stateroom to himself, didn’t have a door to close. It isn’t too much of a stretch to say that there wasn’t room for a private thought. However, everyone was in the same situation. If you expected to have what privacy was possible, you had to respect the privacy of others. Most often, that did work out pretty well. If you needed to be left alone for a bit, you normally would be.
