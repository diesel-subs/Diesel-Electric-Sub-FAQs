# Since the crew size grew, but not the number of bunks, where did they all sleep?


=== "Short Answer"
    There are enough bunks. There just aren’t enough bunks for everyone to have a bunk to themselves. The numbers vary a little based on the actual number of men aboard for the patrol and the actual number of bunks available. However, assume there were about 70 bunks and 80 men.

=== "Detailed Answer"
    There are enough bunks.  There just aren’t enough bunks for everyone to have a bunk to themselves.  The numbers vary a little based on the actual number of men aboard for the patrol and the actual number of bunks available.  However, assume there were about 70 bunks and 80 men.  In that situation, 50 men would have their own bunks.  The other 30 men would be assigned with three men to two bunks.  They were assigned so that one of the three would be on watch at any time.  That meant that if you were one of the 30 junior men and you had an opportunity to sleep - your work was done and your qualifications were current – there was a bunk available.

    That was the good news.  The less good news, for these 30 junior men, was that when they came off watch at midnight or 04:00 (AM) they would be getting into the same bunk that their relief had just gotten out of.  It was called hot bunking for a reason.  To further put that in context, we think the boats rarely were cooler than 90 degrees Fahrenheit if they were in the tropics as most of them were.

    There was the possibility of some good news.  If the captain had an opportunity and fired torpedoes from the after torpedo tubes, bunking could improve.  Reload torpedoes would be moved into the tubes, which were always kept full if possible.  Now, for every torpedo fired, you could make two or three bunks on each empty skid.  For every bunk that is created in this way, three sailors would no longer be hot bunking.
