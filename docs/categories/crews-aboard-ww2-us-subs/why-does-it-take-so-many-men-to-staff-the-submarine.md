=== "Short Answer"
    On the surface at sea, there were a number of jobs to do and there would be one person awake in each compartment to monitor the space for problems or danger. For example, on the surface there would be
The officer of the deck with three or four lookouts on the bridge.

=== "Detailed Answer"
    On the surface at sea, there were a number of jobs to do and there would be one person awake in each compartment to monitor the space for problems or danger.  For example, on the surface there would be
    The officer of the deck with three or four lookouts on the bridge.
    A helmsman, quartermaster (navigation) along with the sonar and radar operators in the conning tower.
    The Chief of the Watch plus an IC electrician and a messenger in the control room.
    A radar operator for the air search and IFF equipment.
    A radioman on watch in the radio room.
    Two electrician mates in maneuvering.
    A motor machinist mate (engineman) and an oiler in each engine room.
    Normally there would be a cook in the crew’s mess.  There would often be a mess cook there too.
    A steward mate in the forward battery.
    A torpedoman on watch in each torpedo room.
    There are other duties, such as an electrician monitoring the battery, particularly during a charge.
    A gunner’s mate to maintain the guns
    
    This is a total of about 24 per shift, and there are three shifts.
    
    When submerged, the duties for some of these men would change.  For example, the officer of the deck (OOD) will become the diving officer and there would be a new OOD in the conning tower.  The oilers in the engine rooms will man the trim manifold and air manifold in the control room.  The lookouts would man the bow and stern planes.  In total, you will need about the same number of men when submerged as on the surface.
    
    You need to have additional personnel on board to allow for trainees, injuries and illness.  Gun crews will also need to be staffed during battle stations.  In addition to these functions, there are the captain, the XO, the yeoman and pharmacist mate who generally aren’t on the watch list.  The yeoman and the pharmacist mate might stand some watches as their primary duties permit.
    
    Since submarines had limited space, were there height and weight limits?
    There was a height limit on these boats.  During WW2, it was six feet, four inches or 1.93 meters.  That means two things.  First, if you are six feet or taller, you probably won’t be able to stretch out on your bunk.  You will sleep on your side curled up a bit.  Second, it means there are multiple obstructions available for you to locate with your head.  In that case, some important medical advice applies: if it hurts when you do that, don’t do that.  A tall crew member who has been on a submarine even for a short while may appear to pay no attention to those painful obstacles, but he has already located them all - and not all the hard way.  Submariners tend to be reasonably bright.
    
    Location memory helps.  In the dark in your home, you know where the furniture is and you avoid it.  Unless, of course, someone has just added something or rearranged everything.
    
    Weight was a different issue.  There were weight limits, adjusted for height, to be met when joining the Navy.  During WW2, there were no official limits after that.  However, there might be informal pressure if you carried too much weight.  You might not want to struggle through the watertight doors if you were seriously overweight.  There have also been reports that the stench on the boats tended to suppress appetites.
    
    At some point after the war, the rules changed.  You then had to under the weight limits each time you reenlisted.
    
    Those were the maximums.  The minimum height and weight limits applied to everyone in the Navy when enlisting.  There were no separate requirements for submarine service.
