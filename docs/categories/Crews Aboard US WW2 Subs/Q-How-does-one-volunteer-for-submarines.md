=== "Summary"
    Prior to WW2, an officer had to serve for two years on a surface ship before he could volunteer at all. However, that requirement ended during the war. The first requirement is still that you have to be odd enough to think that you will enjoy being confined in a small space and underwater for significant periods of time.
=== "Detailed Answer"
    Prior to WW2, an officer had to serve for two years on a surface ship before he could volunteer at all.  However, that requirement ended during the war.

    The first requirement is still that you have to be odd enough to think that you will enjoy being confined in a small space and underwater for significant periods of time.  If so, then you submit your request for submarine service normally through your superiors and then your commanding officer.

    The next step is to pass the preliminary selection.  There are more volunteers than billets (spaces) available, so the submarine force gets their choice.  Selection depends your demonstrated skills and maybe on your specialty.

    The next step is to determine your ability to get along.  For volunteers new to the Navy, this consists of psychological screening.  The submarine service is looking for sailors who can be a teammate with an “even strain.”  Someone who is in your face (either angry or happy) or too retiring will not qualify.  You need to be able to enjoy the banter and mild pranks of your shipmates while working hard as a team when needed.

    Officers who come through the Naval Academy or Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC) programs are already well known to the Navy and are not normally screened again for sub duty.  However, screening for nuclear power billets in submarines or carriers is done and is even more rigorous.
