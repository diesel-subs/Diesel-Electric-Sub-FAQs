=== "Detailed Answer"
    Submariners didn’t usually think so. No one thought a submarine would be spacious when they volunteered. They knew it was small and would be all closed up when submerged. (The non-submarine admirals who complained that the new designs were too plush seemed to think otherwise.) Therefore, the boats did not seem that crowded to the crews.
    NOTE: We sometimes point out that conditions on these submarines do not meet the minimum standards for U. S. prisons. Most of that is simply due to the lack of space per person and the fact that many of the crew will not see daylight for weeks. Some may not even see the sky at night. However, to be fair, conditions on most surface ships aren’t that much better.
    Still, it’s really a matter of what you get used to and the crews quickly became accustomed to the conditions. It simply became the new normal. As Fletcher Pratt wrote about submariners in “The Navy’s War”, page 140: “It was a club of individuals with an almost incredible ability to treat every circumstance as normal.”

    Even though the crew could become accustomed to the close quarters, that didn’t make it ideal. Of course, carrying a significant number of extra passengers, such as rescued personnel or special operations troops would make it more crowded. The crew might have to work a bit harder to make it seem normal.
