# How are things different before a sailor is qualified?


=== "Short Answer"
    When you report aboard your first submarine you are a non-qualified puke (NQP), a life form just below pond scum. Another version of this is that you are a useless food-consuming being (UFB). The main point is that you have a great deal of work to do before you are a qualified submariner.

    The main point is that you have a great deal of work to do before you are a qualified submariner.  You are expected to spend your spare time working on your quals.  During that time, you are not allowed to watch movies or play games.  Your spare time, such as it may be, is supposed to be spent on your qualifications.
